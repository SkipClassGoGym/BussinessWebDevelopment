  <h1>Doc-Centric Sales: Northeast Region</h1>
  <p>
    The Northeast region had a mixed sales year last year. Some models like the C300-25 
    performed admirably, while others like the C200-20 had disappointing years. We anticipate 
    a stronger year in current year with the introduction of the C300-30 model â€” a great 
    copier at a competitive price.
