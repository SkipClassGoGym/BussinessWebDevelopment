  <h1>Doc-Centric Sales: Midwest Region</h1>
  <p>
    The Midwest region had another strong sales year with record-setting sales of both
    the M300-25 and M100-11 models. The only disappointment was the lackluster sales of
    the M300-15 model, which started the year strong but tapered off into the fourth
    quarter. All-in-all though, a very good year for the Midwest region.
