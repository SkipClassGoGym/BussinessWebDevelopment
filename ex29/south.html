  <h1>Doc-Centric Sales: South Region</h1>
  <p>
    Sales in the Southern region were off last year as the economy entered a slight downturn. 
    Sales of the M100-10 model suffered the largest decline â€” 15% under sales two years ago. 
    The lone bright spot was the continuing strong sales of the M300-25 unit which increased 
    as last year progressed.
